# 🎬 Personalized Movie Recommendation System using PySpark & Collaborative Filtering

> 📌 Project 1 of 6 | Pushed as part of my academic + real-world ML portfolio 🚀

## 🧠 Overview
In the ever-growing jungle of streaming content, users often get lost in endless scrolls and mediocre suggestions. Our project dives into solving this problem by building a **personalized movie recommendation system** powered by **collaborative filtering** and **Apache Spark**, capable of processing massive datasets and giving spot-on suggestions based on user behavior.

## 📈 Key Features
- 💡 Personalized suggestions based on **user-item interaction**
- ⚡ Built with **PySpark** on **Apache Spark** for large-scale performance
- 🧪 Evaluated using **RMSE**, **precision**, and **recall**
- 🤝 Scalable, fast, and adaptable to various streaming platforms
- 🔒 Acknowledges **bias and privacy** issues in recommender systems

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: PySpark, Apache Hadoop (HDFS)
- **Tools**: MLlib, Jupyter, VS Code
- **Algorithm**: User-based Collaborative Filtering

## 📂 Dataset
- Contains over **8,000+** user interactions and movie ratings
- Publicly sourced, includes diverse genres, languages, and release years
- Preprocessing steps include handling nulls, normalization, and outlier removal

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the ([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arzubesiroglu/netflix-titles)) which contains millions of user-movie interactions, ratings, and metadata.

> For quick testing, a sample dataset (`netflix_titles.csv`) is included in the `/data` folder.

To use the full dataset:
1. Sign in to Kaggle
2. Download the dataset from the link above
3. Place it in the root directory or update the path in the code accordingly


## 📊 Results
- Achieved **RMSE = 3.7725** on our baseline implementation
- Compared with benchmark paper achieving **RMSE = 1.0742**
- Insights into how **parameter tuning** (lambda, iterations, rank) affects performance
